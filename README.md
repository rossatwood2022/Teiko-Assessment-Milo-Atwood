# Teiko Assessment Milo Atwood

## Overview 
 Hello! This repository contains my solution to the Teiko - Engineering Intern Technical Assessment.

 The folder 'Python-Assignment' contains a Jupyter Notebook called 'CellPopulationAnalysis.ipynb' that computes and analyzes the relative frequencies of the 'cell_count.csv' file. It also contains the output .csv file 'relativeFrequencies.csv'. 

 The file 'Database-Assignment' contains my response for the database assigment, including the rough prototye schema and how to query certain information. 

## How to Run
 To recreate the outputs from the .ipynb, ensure that the input file is in the same directory or in the developing environment's project files, then run all cells.

Looking forward to hearing from the team. Thank you for the opportunity!
